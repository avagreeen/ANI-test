 
## Software

The code was tested with Python 3.4.9 on macOS 12.0.1.

The packages I used to run the code are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

All the code is listed in [tasks.ipynb](tasks.ipynb) file.

To Start with the test, you can create a python virtual environment and run
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then start the Jupiter notebook
```
$ jupyter notebook
```
